Checkpoint / Resuming a Previous Korali Run
=====================================================

In this tutorial we show how to restart a previous Korali run.

Steps to Restart Execution
---------------------------

Assume that we want to resume a previous Korali run, restarting from the one of the last generations. 

Korali will automatically load all the configuration and solver state from the provided file, and run from that point until completion.
You may use this feature to resume an expired job, or create an inital test run to validate your setup.
