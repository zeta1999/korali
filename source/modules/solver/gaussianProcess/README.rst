Gaussian Process
**************************

This solver uses lazy learning and a measure of the similarity between points (the kernel function) to predict the value for an unseen point from training data. The prediction is not just an estimate for that point, but also has uncertainty information â€” it is a one-dimensional Gaussian distribution.
